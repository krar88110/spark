*)   RDD transformations are conceptually similar to Scala collection method but with a
     difference i.e. Scala collection needs the data to fit in memory of a single machine
	 where as RDD can operate on data distributed across cluster of nodes
*)   Another difference is that scala collection method are strict but RDD transformations
     are lazy
