*)   Consider we have a collection called jar on a single node and using Scala parallel collection
	 when we call the following code on it
	 
	 val res = jar.map { jellybean => doSomething(jellybean) }
	 
	 On a single node, under the hood following things will happen
	 
	 1) Split the data into multiple chunks
	 2) Workers/threads working parallel on the data shards
	 3) Combine the results when done
