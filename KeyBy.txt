*)   Its a higher order method, which takes as input a function which would be applied to every element. The result would be
     new pair RDD in which first element is the key generated by input function and second element is the element itself.
	 
*)   Difference with groupBy is that groupBy returns a collection of elements with the key where as keyBy sends individual
     elements with the key
	 
*)   The new RDD should have exactly same number of elements as the source RDD
